## Problem Statement
Present metal detection systems for security purposes work on the principle of electromagnetic induction some are X-Ray based. They have a small coverage area and require dedicated expensive hardware. Also, ionizing radiations of X-Ray are harmful for the skin. Hence, there is a great need to having unobtrusive metal detectors which cover a larger area
